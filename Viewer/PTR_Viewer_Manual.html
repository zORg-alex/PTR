<p>For PTR manual go <a href="../README.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>Windows Presentation Foundation</strong> project. It connects to a
PTR database and presents it's data to an administrator to overview
and export user data.</p>
<p>It is constructed on <strong>MVVM pattern</strong> (Model-ViewModel-View)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model</strong> is a database and all classes used to model data.</li>
<li><strong>ViewModel</strong> classes are called *ViewModel.cs to distinguish them.
This is what every Window and many controls get as DataContext.</li>
<li><strong>Views</strong> are all Windows and CustomControls that are named
appropriately or stored in same named folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>They communicate this way Vivew &lt;--&gt; ViewModel are interconnected,
and ViewModel --&gt; Model.</p>
<p>MVVM pattern helps to keep project flexible and easy to understand.
Since it is a big project it is better to keep it structured and
junk free.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO create a WIP project and Clean project to wreck a
havok in WIP one and copy (once in a while) only necessary code to a
Clean one. Will it work better? It helped a lot to rewrite whole
project and strip out unnecessary and deprecated code once it was
barely readable. BTW since then this stricture is as it is.</p>
